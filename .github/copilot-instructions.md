Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

We do not use objects, arrow functions, or array iteration methods.

We use `for()` loops as needed.

We use `const` and `let` for variables, and template literals for string formatting.

We use || and && in conditionals when necessary.
